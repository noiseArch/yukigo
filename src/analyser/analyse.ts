// TODO: Make a analyser that executes different checks depending of the inspection provided in the expections.yml

// Like:
// {binding: function1, inspection: UsesGuards} -> Checks if function1 has a guarded body
// {binding: function2, inspection: HasUsage:esMultiploDe } -> Checks if function2 has esMultiploDe in it's body
// {binding: function3, inspection: Not:HasBinding } -> Checks that function3 is not declared anywhere, throws if it is.
// etc
